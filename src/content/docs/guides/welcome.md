## Our Philisophy

What makes Formatif different from other learning systems is that it is designed from the ground-up to be feedback-focused, rather than assessment focused. With real-time student-progress tracking, great communication tools such as audio feedback, and a focus on student reflection, Formatif is designed to help students learn, rather than just pass.

Formatif is an open-source project built by a passionate team of educators here in Australia.
